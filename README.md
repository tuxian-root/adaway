# adaway

It is a simple shell script which gets the list of adserver list from different sources and updates your hosts file.
I would recommend to run this script weekly once to get the latest server list.

<b>Installation:</b></br>
`sh adaway.sh`

You can automate this update by adding this script to your boot scripts.</br>
<pre>
If Linux, try google "RC scripts"
   Windows, keep the script in Startup folder
   Mac, add the script to System Preferences -> Accounts -> Login items.
</pre>
